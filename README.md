There is no equivalent to [BD-Maps'](http://www.bd-maps.net/isolates/) following fields:

- Global ID: Redundant to sample ID
- Country / Continent / Region: Redundant and derivable from coordinate bounding boxes
- Elevation: Lookup-able from sample coordinates
- Accuracy: Should be built in to `radius` field.
- Coordinate source: Is the model of GPS actually relevant?
- Developmental stage: Per-sample, should be included in raw data. At a high level, redundant to `sampled_species_detail[N].sampled_life_stages`
- Method of detection: Since this may vary on a per-sample basis, this is relegated to the raw data.
- Abnormalities: Problems in data are encapsulated in `disease_no_confidence`, problems with animals belong with the raw data.
