WhichBrowser/Parser
===================

> **Everybody lies**  â€” House M.D.

This is an extremely complicated and almost completely useless browser sniffing library written in PHP. Useless because you shouldn't use browser sniffing. So stop right now and go read something about feature detecting instead. I'm serious. Go away. You'll thank me later.

**But why *almost completely useless* and not completely useless?**  
Well, there is always an exception to the rule. There is one valid reason to do browser sniffing: to gather intelligence about which browsers are used on your website. My website is html5test.com and I wanted to know which score belongs to which browser. And to do that you need a browser sniffing library.

**Why is it extremely complicated?**  
Because everybody lies. Seriously, there is not a single browser that is completely truthful. Almost all browsers say they are Netscape 5 and almost all WebKit browsers say they are based on Gecko. Even Internet Explorer 11 now no longer claims to be IE at all, but instead an unnamed browser that is like Gecko. And it gets worse. That is why it is complicated.

**What kind of information does it give?**
You get a nice object which has information about the browser, rendering engine, os and device. It gives you names and versions and even device manufacturer and model. And WhichBrowser is pretty tenacious. It gives you info that others don't. For example:

    JUC (Linux; U; 2.3.6; zh-cn; GT-I8150; 480*800) UCWEB8.7.4.225/145/800  
    UC Browser 8.7 on a Samsung Galaxy W running Android 2.3.6

Android is never mentioned

    Mozilla/5.0 (Series40; Nokia501/10.0.2; Profile/MIDP-2.1 Configuration/CLDC-1.1) Gecko/20100401 S40OviBrowser/3.0.0.0.73  
    Nokia Xpress 3.0.0 on a Nokia Asha 501 running Nokia Asha Platform

Despite the useragent header claiming to be a Series40 device, we know it's actually running the Asha Platform and we also know that OviBrowser has been renamed to Nokia Xpress.

    Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux zvav; U; zh) Presto/2.8.119 Version/11.10  
    Opera Mini on a Nokia 5230 running Series60 5.0

The useragent header looks like Opera 11.10 on Linux, but we know it's Opera Mini. We can even figure out the real operating system and device model from other headers.



How to install it
-----------------

You can install WhichBrowser by using Composer - the standard package manager for PHP. The package is called `whichbrowser/parser`.

    composer require whichbrowser/parser

And just like the Git method, you can easily update WhichBrowser by running a simple command.

    composer update

You should run this command as often as possible. You might even want to consider setting up a cron job for this purpose.




How to use it
-------------

The first step require the Composer autoloader:

    <?php

        require 'vendor/autoload.php';

The second step is to create a new `WhichBrowser\Parser` object. This object will contain all the information the library could find about the browser. The object has a required parameter, either the headers send by the browser, or a useragent string. Using the headers if preferable, because it will allow a better detection, but if you have just the useragent string, this will also work.

For example:

    $result = new WhichBrowser\Parser(getallheaders());

or:

    $result = new WhichBrowser\Parser($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);


The variable `$result` now contains an object which you can query for information. There are various ways to access the information.


First of all, you can call to toString() function to get a human readable identification:

    "You are using " . $result->toString();
    // You are using Chrome 27 on Mac OS X 10.8.4


Another possiblity is to query the object:

    $result->isType('desktop');
    // true

    $result->isType('mobile', 'tablet', 'media');
    // false

    $result->isBrowser('Maxthon', '<', '4.0.5');
    // false

    $result->isOs('iOS', '>=', '5');
    // false

    $result->isEngine('Blink');
    // true


You can also access these properties directly:

    $result->browser->toString();
    // Chrome 27  

    $result->engine->toString();
    // Blink

    $result->os->toString();
    // Mac OS X 10.8.4


Or access parts of these properties directly:

    $result->browser->name;
    // Chrome

    $result->browser->name . ' ' . $result->browser->version.toString();
    // Chrome 27

    $result->browser->version->value;
    // 27.0.1453.110

    $result->engine->name;
    // Blink


Finally you can also query versions directly:

    $result->browser->version->is('>', 26);
    // true

    $result->os->version->is('<', '10.7.4');
    // false


API reference
-------------

### The Parser object

After a new `WhichBrowser\Parser` object is created, it contains a number of properties and functions. All of these properties are guaranteed to be present.

**Properties:**

* `browser`  
  an object that contains information about the browser itself
* `engine`  
  an object that contains information about the rendering engine
* `os`  
  an object that contains information about the operating system
* `device`  
  an object that contains information about the device

**Functions:**

`isType($type [,$type [,$type [,$type]]])`  
If a single argument is used, the function returns `true` if the argument matches the `type` propery of `device` obejct. It can use multiple arguments in which case the function returns `true` if one of the arguments matches. If none of the arguments matches, it returns `false`

`isBrowser($name [, $comparison, $version])`  
Is used to query the `name` and `version` property of the `browser` object. The funcion can contain a single argument to a simple comparison based on `name`, or three arguments to compare both `name` and `version`. The first argument always contains the name of the browser. The second arguments is a string that can container either `<`, `<=`, `=`, `=>` or `>`. The third is an integer, float or string that contains the version. You can use versions like `10`, `10.7` or `'10.7.4'`. For more information about how version comparisons are performed, please see the `is()` function of the `Version` object.

`isEngine($name [, $comparison, $version])`  
Is used to query the `name` and `version` property of the `engine` object. This function works in exactly the same way as `isBrowser`.

`isOs($name [, $comparison, $version])`  
Is used to query the `name` and `version` property of the `os` object. This function works in exactly the same way as `isBrowser`.


### The browser object

The `WhichBrowser\Browser` object is used for the `browser` property of the main `WhichBrowser\Parser` object and contains a number of properties. If a property is not applicable in this situation it will be null or undefined.

**Properties:**

* `name`  
  a string containing the name of the browser
* `version`  
  a version object containing information about the version of the browser
* `stock`  
  a boolean, true if the browser is the default browser of the operating system, false otherwise
* `channel`  
  a string containing the distribution channel, ie. 'Nightly' or 'Next'.
* `mode`  
  a string that can contain the operating mode of the browser, ie. 'proxy'.
* `hidden`  
  a boolean that is true if the browser does not have a name and is the default of the operating system.


### The engine object

The `WhichBrowser\Engine` object is used for the `engine` property of the main `WhichBrowser\Parser` object and contains a number of properties. If a property is not applicable in this situation it will be null or undefined.

**Properties:**

* `name`  
  a string containing the name of the rendering engine
* `version`  
  a version object containing information about the version of the rendering engine


### The os object

The `WhichBrowser\Os` object is used for the `os` property of the main `WhichBrowser\Parser` object and contains a number of properties. If a property is not applicable in this situation it will be null or undefined.

**Properties:**

* `name`  
  a string containing the name of the operating system
* `version`  
  a version object containing information about the version of the operating system


### The device object

The `WhichBrowser\Device` object is used for the `device` property of the main `WhichBrowser\Parser` object and contains a number of properties. If a property is not applicable in this situation it will be null or undefined.

**Properties:**

* `type`  
  a string containing the type of the browser.
* `identified`  
  a boolean that is true if the device has been positively identified.
* `manufacturer`  
  a string containing the manufacturer of the device, ie. 'Apple' or 'Samsung'.
* `model`  
  as string containing the model of the device, ie. 'iPhone' or 'Galaxy S4'.

The `type` property can contain any value from the following list:

* desktop
* mobile
* tablet
* gaming
* headset
* ereader
* media
* emulator
* television
* monitor
* camera
* signage
* whiteboard
* car
* pos
* bot


### The version object

The `WhichBrowser\Version` object is used for the `version` property of the `browser`, `engine` and `os` object and contains a number of properties and functions. If a property is not applicable in this situation it will be null or undefined.

**Properties:**

* `value`  
  a string containing the original version number.
* `alias`  
  a string containing an alias for the version number, ie. 'XP' for Windows '5.1'.
* `details`  
  an integer containing the number of digits of the version number that should be printed.

**Functions:**

`is($version)` or `is($comparison, $version)`  
Using this function it is easy to compare a version to another version. If you specify only one argument, this function will return if the versions are the same. You can also specify two arguments, in that case the first argument contains the comparison operator, such as `<`, `<=`, `=`, `=>` or `>`. The second argument is the version you want to compare it to. You can use versions like `10`, `10.7` or `'10.7.4'`, but be aware that `10` is not the same as `10.0`. For example if our OS version is `10.7.4`:

    $result->os->version->is('10.7.4'); 
    // true

    $result->os->version->is('10.7');
    // true

    $result->os->version->is('10');
    // true

    $result->os->version->is('10.0');
    // false

    $result->os->version->is('>', '10');
    // false

    $result->os->version->is('>', '10.7');
    // false

    $result->os->version->is('>', '10.7.3');
    // true
