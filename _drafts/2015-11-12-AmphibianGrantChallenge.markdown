[Amphibian Grant Challenge](https://www.instrumentl.com/campaigns/category/amphibian/) begins!

[Instrumentl](https://www.instrumentl.com), a platform for researchers to crowdfund their research projects, has started a grant challenge for researchers to conserve amphibian biodiversity. Proposed projects range from amphibian disease to habitat/ distribution studies to school outreach programs. Donate now and help fight against amphibian extinctions!

AmphibiaWeb is donating one item from their [online store](http://www.zazzle.com/amphibiaweb) to donors who give $100 or more to one of the following _Bsal_ projects. Data from these projects will be contributed to the amphibian disease portal and be made publicly available. 

[Biodiversity Crisis - Let's be prepared!](https://www.instrumentl.com/campaigns/biodiversity-crisis-lets-be-prepared/): Shruti Chaulkulkar at San Francisco State University will study historical to present-day prevalence of _Bsal_ and conduct susceptibility trials for west coast salamanders.

[Save Our Salamanders!](https://www.instrumentl.com/campaigns/the-hunt-for-a-deadly-salamander-disease/): Heidi Rockney will go to Asia to search for the source of  _Bsal_ and identify the distributions of potential reservoirs.
