## [Main page](https://amphibiandisease.org)

On this page, you can find projects, or samples within projects, that match the specified criteria.

By default, your search bounds are equal to the visible viewport area of map. If you disable the toggle switch, then the bounds will be defined by the bounds in the input.

Searching the entire project is the default. It will show all results for all projects that have any matching criteria.

You can also search samples, and find and highlight samples on the map that only match the sample data.

For any returned samples, clicking on the point will present an infowindow that will contain a summary of that data.
