We've compiled a [Bibliography for publications on Bd and Bsal research as a Zotero Group Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/bdbsalresearch/items/order/year/sort/desc).     

There are two tags consistently used: **Bd** and **Bsal**
If you want to filter the publications to only those relating to only one of the chytrid fungus, e.g., click on  **Bd** tag on the left to filter the items list.    

If you want to contribute to the Group Library, join this public repository with your free Zotero account. This is a great way to add to your own collection of references or to see the latest additions.     

Why [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)? It's free, open source, convenient and widely used by academics,  librarians, and writers. Read a perspective on [using Zotero](http://at.blogs.wm.edu/doing-academic-research-with-zotero/).
