#The US Pet Industry Tackles _Bsal_ Threat

The Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council (PIJAC) has recommended that all importers, exporters
and buyers place a voluntary temporary moratorium on firebelly and paddletail newts 
(_Cynops orientalis_ and _Pachytriton labiatus_) to thwart the spread of _Bsal_ to US
salamander populations. They also ask all businesses to regularly sanitize their facilities 
as a precautionary measure while government agencies, industry, and researchers work towards 
effective _Bsal_ testing and treatment protocols.
