[The Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats](http://www.coe.int/en/web/bern-convention) 
is binding international legal text that was adopted 
over thirty years ago to protect Europe's wild plants and animals. In December 2015 the Convention
had its 35th annual Standing Committee meeting at the Palace of Europe in Strasbourg, France. 
With _Bsal_ already decimating wild European fire salamander populations in the Netherlands and 
its spread to the UK and Germany via the pet trade, the Convention's Standing Committee has officially 
recommended restrictions on trade and best management practices. The Committee stresses the 
importance of implementation and enforcement in order to conserve amphibian biodiversity.

The recommendations include immediate salamander trade restrictions until risk assessments and 
prevention/mitigation protocols are developed; pre-import screening for infectious diseases 
in live animal trade; establishing monitoring and surveillance programs 
both where _Bsal_ has been introduced and in high risk areas that are still _Bsal_-free; 
applying biosafety rules to field work, breeding sites, and captive collections; 
and developing emergency action plans.

Says Tom Langton, a conservation ecologist and expert consultant on amphibian and reptile conservation 
priorities to the Bern Convention in 2015: "A huge debt of gratitude must be paid to the Council of Europe 
and the Swiss government for their prompt intervention. The massive risks to biodiversity from the 
increasingly damaging international pet trade are long known. Costs will be cripplingly high and with 
no guaranteed outcome. One has to look to the failure of CITES and EU controls over 20 years in arriving 
at such inevitable crisis. The meagre economic benefits of the often damaging trade in wild animals are 
not sustainable. Europe needs a similar system to Australia, where wildlife management is more professional 
and credible."

Other countries have yet to take action against the spread of this lethal wildlife pathogen. Despite the 
impending threat of _Bsal_ being introduced to North America, where almost 50% of the world's salamander 
species occur, no action has been taken to avert this crisis. Hopefully other governing agencies will see
the importance of preventive action and join in on the international effort to mitigate the spread 
of infectious diseases in wildlife and conserve biodiversity.
