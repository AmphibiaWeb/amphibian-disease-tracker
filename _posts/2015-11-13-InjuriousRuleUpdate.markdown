The US is evaluating which salamander species to list as "injurious" under the Lacey Act. Since there are no current international or US laws or regulations in place to call on emergency protocols for emerging infectious diseases in wildlife, the US must rely on the Lacey Act to prevent _Bsal_ from entering the US. Despite the calls to action by various amphibian and disease experts to place a temporary ban on live salamander imports into the US until we have a better understanding of _Bsal_ disease dynamics, the US Fish and Wildlife Service has not yet taken any formal action.
