When the fungal pathogen _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ (_Bd_) was first described in 1999, action was not taken rapidly, and a global amphibian pandemic ensued. We have since found that _Bd_ has caused the declines and extinctions of over 200 species worldwide, and, as it continues to spread, numerous amphibian populations are constantly at risk. With the recent discovery of a second, closely related fungal pathogen, _Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans_ (_Bsal_), and its presence in international trade, a second amphibian pandemic is looming. In an article published in EcoHealth, [Yap et al. (2017)](http://em.rdcu.be/wf/click?upn=KP7O1RED-2BlD0F9LDqGVeSDtXYGQFpgHv0ZJCZGOBVbc-3D_7kYTGq1CVaLDrCiq6VvFhbqpuoalbTKCrOoLt-2BaFEN6-2FqRC2GBzyOpEi1O31aCZjVg7843E3eKFGUs8LBwCJ3mKVpGwz7rHXPnaJjJA0U9YZM7XnoX3eu022cNjYKzbevptIu6frmSGCYbBLZC26Rn-2Fk02eNOO8Fk67gdbW-2B2OHVzD99EKWo14MZksIcyrfguyuLKzdsp48Pdglqr0froAtPfQt0xKWVNYP6POJfjodqIkWC-2B7NAy-2FzKxPz2aK4pHgwOOOW4GJssMvIUE2ZKKw-3D-3D) review what is known about _Bsal_ - its biology, disease pathology, known distribution and susceptible species, diagnostic methods, and potential treatments. They discuss the global efforts to minimize its spread, highlighting the efforts of the [_Bsal_ Task Force](http://www.salamanderfungus.org/task-force/), and they bring attention to regulatory gaps that impede a rapid response.

Proactive policy action was and continues to be an important step for amphibian diversity conservation. Almost two years ago the [United States placed restrictions on salamander imports](https://www.fws.gov/injuriouswildlife/salamanders.html) to prevent the spread of _Bsal_, and [recently Canada followed suit](http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2017/2017-05-31/html/sor-dors86-eng.php). These actions seem to be benefiting local salamander populations; several published reports indicate that _Bsal_ has not yet been detected in captive or wild salamanders in North America ([Klocke et al. 2017](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Blake_Klocke/publication/320373043_Batrachochytrium_salamandrivorans_not_detected_in_US_survey_of_pet_salamanders/links/59e08a55458515371613fc96/Batrachochytrium-salamandrivorans-not-detected-in-US-survey-of-pet-salamanders.pdf), [Govindarajulu et al. 2017](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WIEDE9bIzyp6j5PWxxh_F6nuO95wvpEw)).  In addition, the United States Geological Survey has been conducting targeted surveys throughout the United States, and so far all salamanders have been found to be _Bsal_-free. While this is great news, salamanders are not yet in the clear.

Initially it was believed that only salamanders could be infected by _Bsal_; however, in April 2017 a study came out showing that captive midwife toads (_Alytes obstetricans_) could be infected and transmit the pathogen to cohoused salamanders ([Stegen et al. 2017](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Oqu-UzJKzVjkO9wPO0WjNbICrE4pMPQg)). Alarmingly, _Bsal_ has also been found on Yunnan fire-bellied toads (_Bombina microdeladigitora_), both in the wild in Vietnam and in trade animals in Germany ([Nguyen et al. 2017](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BohmX1EfWQQg1MOmrYXfuvnf0jA_SHRR)). This alternate pathway for _Bsal_ to spread through frog vectors in trade poses a severe threat. [The scientific community is now calling on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to fortify their response to this crisis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pHwb6G18ql0hM7JVvAVNiGMfiE6f8rcx) by extending a moratorium on all amphibian imports until a clean trade program is implemented to ensure that all trade animals are free of _Bsal_ and any other disease.
