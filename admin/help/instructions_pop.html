      Adding Two-Factor Authentication to your account
    </h1>
    <p>
      Two factor authentication is a way to secure your account, even
      in the event that a malicious party steals your password.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Get the Software</h2>
    <p>
      Get a TOTP compliant application, like Google Authenticator, for your mobile
      device. Here are some suggestions; click on the picture that corresponds to your mobile
      device to be taken to the appropriate App store.

    <h2>2. Set it up</h2>
    <p>
      On the two-factor authentication page, once you've logged in,
      scan the barcode shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If you can't scan the barcode</strong>, click the link above the barcode
      to manually input your key. Type in the key shown, ignoring
      spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      You device should now show a six-digit code that changes every
      30 seconds.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Use It</h2>
    <p>
      Input the code you see to verify that it's working correctly,
      and you're done! <strong>Be sure that your phone's clock is accurate!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll get a 32-character backup code. Save this code in case
      you lose your device, as it's the only way to remove two-factor
      authentication without your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've verified your phone number, once you've enabled
      two-factor authentication you can also recieve your code by text
      message.
