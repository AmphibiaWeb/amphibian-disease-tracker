====================================

Just remember a few guidelines:

1. SCREENSHOTS! If you find a bug, screenshot it. That's going to be the first step on our way to reproducing it. Upload the screenshot into the issue.
2. If you can replicate the bug:
  1. Right-click the "Report a Bug" icon in the footer, and click "Enable Debug Logging". A red "send" arrow will appear.
  2. Go ahead and replicate the issue
  3. Once you have, click the send button
  4. When you click it, it'll open up a dialog with some debug messages you can share.
  5. Copy-paste that data into this bug report.
2. More is better. More details means it's more likely that the error can be reproduced. What were you doing beforehand, for example?
3. Make it clear if this is a feature request, bug, or API issue.
4. Did you check https://amphibian-disease-tracker.readthedocs.org ? [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/amphibian-disease-tracker/badge/?version=latest)](http://amphibian-disease-tracker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)
