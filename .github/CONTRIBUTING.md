====================================

Just remember a few guidelines:

1. SCREENSHOTS! If you find a bug, screenshot it. That's going to be the first step on our way to reproducing it. Upload the screenshot into the issue.
2. More is better. More details means it's more likely that the error can be reproduced. What were you doing beforehand, for example?
3. Make it clear if this is a feature request, bug, or API issue.
4. Did you check https://amphibian-disease-tracker.readthedocs.org ? [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/amphibian-disease-tracker/badge/?version=latest)](http://amphibian-disease-tracker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Thanks!
