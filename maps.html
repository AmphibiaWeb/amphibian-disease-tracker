<p>Example 1</p>
<p>How this was made: heat map of all samples and all years that were tested positive for Bd from one pilot lab. Clusters of samples increase the 'heat', which is best seen when zooming into areas of intensity and seeing the heat blobs decompose to sample sites. No distinctions are made for prevalence data or whether sample was wild caught and released or from museum collection. Dataset and map are global and interactive.</p>

<p>Example 2</p>
<p>How this was made: intensity map of all samples and all years that tested negative for Bd from one pilot lab. Darker colors are increased sample records for a site, which includes both wild caught and released and museum collections. Dataset and map are global and interactive.</p>
